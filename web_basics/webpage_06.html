     <p>   
     So here ,I am gonna work on the css box model which you can see in the web dev tools ,by inspecting the web page you are working on.</p>

     <p>Box structure mainly consists of the sizes of the margin,border,padding and the size of the main element in the box, we can change the styles of the box model in the way we like by adding few css,So I am gonna do it in this page.</p>

     <p>I hope you all are doing Good.</p>

     <h2><u>Margin:</u></h2>
     <p>So margin is the outermost of all the properties of the box model(you can inspect)
        so, as a quick reference margin gives the space between other elements in the web page .We can give margin values as top,right,bottom,left in css.
     </p>

     <h2><u>Padding:</u></h2>
     <p>The next property in the box model is the padding which will add the space between the main element in the box and the border </p>
     
     <h2><u>Border:</u></h2>
     <p>As weknow, border property can be used to draw border around any element in html.It too actually have many styles(SOLID,DOUBLE,RIDGE...) you can refer the link below to get to know more about many styles. </p>
